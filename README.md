# **SQL Solutions Repository**

Welcome to my sql intreview solutions repository! ðŸš€ 


## *About This Repository*

As I work through various reasources for interview prep, this repository contains my solutions so far. At the moment, my focus is on the LeetCode SQL 50 Study plan. This is a curated set of essential coding problems designed to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. The goal is to solidify my understanding SQL while maintaining clean, well-documented code.

## _Progress_

I am currently working through the LeetCode SQL 50 with MySQL. I will continue updating this repository as I progress.

âœ… Completed: Select, Basic Joins, Basic Aggregate Functions, Sorting and Grouping, Advanced Select and Joins

ðŸš§ In progress: Subqueries

ðŸ”œ Upcoming: Advanced String Functions/Regex/Clause

## _How to Use_

If you're also going through any of these, feel free to reference these solutions and compare approaches. Each solution file includes a link to the problem it's solving, however I highly recommend attempting the problems yourself before reviewing solutions!

## _Contributions_

This repository is primarily for personal learning and progress tracking, but if you find any improvements or have alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Let's learn together! ðŸ˜Š
